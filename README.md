## 🛠 How It Works

1. **Frontend (`index.html`, `script.js`, `style.css`)**

   * Displays a chat window for the user.
   * Sends user messages to the backend via HTTP requests.
   * Shows chatbot replies instantly.

2. **Backend (`app.py`)**

   * Runs a Flask server.
   * Processes messages and sends automated responses.
   * You can extend it to integrate AI/ML models or APIs.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Integrate an NLP model (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Rasa).
* Add user authentication for personalized support.
* Store conversation history in a database.
* Enable voice input/output.

If you’d like, I can also **open `app.py` and document exactly how your chatbot works internally**, so the README includes real example code and API details. That will make it even more professional.
Do you want me to do that?
